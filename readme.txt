Interactive maps and markers on your posts and pages with simple shortcodes.

== Description ==

Add a map generated with [LeafletJS](http://leafletjs.com/): an open-source JavaScript library for mobile-friendly interactive maps. Map tiles are provided by default through [OpenStreetMap](http://www.openstreetmap.org/), or [MapQuest](https://www.mapquest.ca/) (with an app key).  Can be set per map with shortcode attributes or through the dashboard settings.

= Maps =

Simply create a **map** with:

`[leaflet-map]`

Lookup an address with:

`[leaflet-map address="chicago"]`

Know the latitude and longitude of a location? Use them (and a zoom level) with:

`[leaflet-map lat=44.67 lng=-63.61 zoom=5]`

Add a **marker** under your map shortcode, like so:

`
[leaflet-map]
[leaflet-marker]
`

Want more? Make more (and fit the map to contain all of them):

`
[leaflet-map fitbounds]
[leaflet-marker address="tokyo"]
[leaflet-marker address="oslo"]
[leaflet-marker address="cairo"]
[leaflet-marker address="toronto"]
`

You can even add **popups** (to any shape) with their names:

`
[leaflet-map fitbounds]
[leaflet-marker address="tokyo"]Tokyo[/leaflet-marker]
[leaflet-marker address="oslo"]Oslo[/leaflet-marker]
...
`

Add a link to the popup messages the same way you would add any other link with the WordPress editor.

= Other Shapes, GeoJSON, and KML =

Add a line to the map by adding `[leaflet-line]`. You can specify the postions with a list separated by semi-colon `;` or bar `|` using lat/lng: `[leaflet-line latlngs="41, 29; 44, 18"]` or addresses: `[leaflet-line addresses="Istanbul; Sarajevo"]`, or x/y coordinates for image maps.

Add a circle to the map by adding `[leaflet-circle]`. You can specify the position using `lat` and `lng` and the radius in meters using `radius`. You can also customize the style using [Leaflet's Path options](https://leafletjs.com/reference.html#path-option). Example: `[leaflet-circle message="max distance" lng=5.117909610271454 lat=52.097914814706094 radius=17500 color="#0DC143" fillOpacity=0.1]`.

Or you can add a geojson shape via a url (make sure you are allowed to access it if it's not hosted on your own server): `[leaflet-geojson src="https://example.com/path/to.geojson"]`.  Add custom popups with field names; try out the default src file and fields like so: 

`
[leaflet-map fitbounds]
[leaflet-geojson]{name}[/leaflet-geojson]
`

`name` is a property on that GeoJSON, and it can be accessed with curly brackets and the property name.

= Image Maps =

Alternatively, you could use a plain image for visitors to zoom and pan around with `[leaflet-image src="path/to/image/file.jpg"]`.  See screenshots 3 - 5 for help setting that up.

= More =

Check out other examples on the Shortcode Helper page in the Leaflet Map admin section.

Check out the **source code** and **more** details on [GitHub](https://github.com/bozdoz/wp-plugin-leaflet-map)!

== Installation ==

1. Choose to add a new plugin, then click upload
2. Upload the leaflet-map zip
3. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
4. Use the shortcodes in your pages or posts: e.g. `[leaflet-map]` and `[leaflet-marker]`

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can I have an SVG Marker? =

Yes! Convert the default marker into an svg with a shortcode like this: `[leaflet-marker svg color="white" iconClass="fab fa-wordpress-simple" background="red"]` The `iconClass` is perfect for adding a [font-awesome](https://fontawesome.com/icons?d=gallery) icon.

= How do I change the style for lines/geojson? =

Pass the style attributes to the respective shortcodes (see all options on [LeafletJS](http://leafletjs.com/reference-1.0.3.html#path)):

`[leaflet-line color="red" weight=10 dasharray="2,15" addresses="Halifax, NS; Tanzania" classname=marching-ants]`

= Can I add geojson? =

Yes, just give it a source URL: `[leaflet-geojson src="https://example.com/path/to.geojson"]` It will also support leaflet geojson styles or geojson.io styles. Add a popup message with `[leaflet-geojson popup_text="hello!"]`, or add HTML by adding it to the content of the shortcode: `[leaflet-geojson]<a href="#">Link here, or use text from a feature property, like {title}</a>[/leaflet-geojson]` or identify a geojson property with `popup_property`, and each shape will use its own popup text if available.

= Can I add kml/gpx? =

Sure!? Use the same attributes as leaflet-geojson (above), but use the `[leaflet-kml]` or `[leaflet-gpx]` shortcode.

= Can I add a message to a marker? =

Yes: `[leaflet-marker visible]Hello there![/leaflet-marker]`, where visible designates if it is visible on page load. Otherwise it is only visible when clicked.

= Can I use your plugin with a picture instead of a map? =

Yes: Use `[leaflet-image src="path/to/image/file.jpg"]`.  See screenshots 3 - 5 for help setting that up.

= Can I use my own self-hosted Leaflet files? =

Yes: Add your custom URL to the options in the admin page.

= How can I add a link to a marker? =

Use the marker format `[leaflet-marker]Click here![/leaflet-marker]` and add a hyperlink like you normally would with the WordPress editor.

= I need more functions!

Take a look at the functions of [Extensions for Leaflet Map](https://wordpress.org/plugins/extensions-leaflet-map/).

= Additional questions? =

For more FAQs, please visit the [FAQ section on GitHub here](https://github.com/bozdoz/wp-plugin-leaflet-map#frequently-asked-questions).

== Screenshots ==

1. Put the shortcode into the post.
2. See the shortcode play out on the front end.
3. For `[leaflet-image]` upload an image, and copy the URL from the right-hand side
4. For `[leaflet-image]` paste that image URL into an attribute titled `source`: example: `src="https://picsum.photos/1000/1000/"`.
5. See the `[leaflet-image]` on the front end.
6. If you use `[leaflet-marker draggable]`, then you can drag the marker where you want it, open a developers console, and see the specific shortcode to use.
7. Add geojson via URL: `[leaflet-geojson src="https://example.com/path/to.geojson"]`
8. MapQuest requires an app key, get it from their website; alternatively, you can use OpenStreetMap as a free tile service (remember to add an attribution where necessary).
